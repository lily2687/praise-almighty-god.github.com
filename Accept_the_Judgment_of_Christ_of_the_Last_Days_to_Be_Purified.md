You only know that Jesus shall descend during the last days, 
but how exactly will He descend? 
A sinner such as you, who has just been redeemed, 
and has not been changed, or been perfected by God, 
can you be after God’s heart?
For you, you who are still of your old self,
it is true that you were saved by Jesus, 
and that you are not counted as a sinner because of the salvation of God, 
but this does not prove that you are not sinful, and are not impure. 
How can you be saintly if you have not been changed? 
Within, you are beset by impurity, selfish and mean, 
yet you still wish to descend with Jesus— you should be so lucky!
You have missed a step in your **[belief in God](https://www.holyspiritspeaks.org/testimonies/have-true-faith-in-God/): 
You have merely been redeemed, but you have not been changed. 
For you to be after God’s heart, 
God must personally do the work of changing and cleansing you; 
if you are only redeemed, you will be incapable of attaining sanctity.
In this way you will be unqualified to share in the good blessings of God,
for you have missed out a step in God’s work of managing man, 
which is the key step of changing and perfecting. 
You, a sinner who has just been redeemed,
are therefore incapable of directly inheriting God’s inheritance. 
The second incarnation is no longer to serve as a sin offering 
but rather to save fully those who were redeemed from sin, 
to save fully those who were redeemed from sin. 
This is done so that those who have been forgiven 
may be delivered from their sins and made fully clean, 
and by attaining a changed disposition, 
break free of Satan’s influence of darkness 
and return before the throne of God. 
Only in this way can man be fully sanctified. 
Only in this way can man be fully sanctified. 
Only in this way can man be fully sanctified.
