The main character's father had been a believer for years. He consistently did his duty to share the **[gospel](https://www.holyspiritspeaks.org/gospel/) and had been able to suffer and pay a price. However, he did not pursue the truth, but instead pursued fame, gain, and status. He sowed discord among brothers and sisters, even going so far as to exclude and attack others, thus seriously disrupting church life and brothers' and sisters' life entry. Fellowship and help were offered to him many times, but he never repented. Through God's words, the main character comes to discern that her father is an evil person who is sick of the truth and hates the truth, and that he should be expelled from the church. She's held back by her emotions, however, and doesn't dare expose or report him. She seeks the truth through reading God's words and sees the nature, danger, and consequences of acting on emotion. She is freed from the bonds of her personal feelings and becomes able to practice loving what God loves and hating what God hates, and she exposes her father's evil behavior. The life of the church takes a turn for the better after his expulsion, freed from the disruption of an evil person.
