## Word of **[Almighty God](https://www.holyspiritspeaks.org/)** | "God's Work, God's Disposition, and God Himself I" | Excerpt 21

God has been doing His work since creating mankind. At the start, the work was very simple, but even so, it still contained expressions of God’s essence and disposition. While God’s work has now been elevated, with Him putting an enormous amount of concrete work into every person who follows Him and expressing a significant amount of His word, from the beginning until now, God’s person has been hidden from mankind. Although He has been incarnated twice, from the time of the biblical accounts to modern days, who has ever seen God’s real person? Based on your understanding, has anyone ever seen God’s real person? No. No one has seen God’s real person, meaning no one has ever seen God’s true self. This is something everybody is in consensus with. That is to say, God’s real person, or God’s Spirit, is concealed from all of humanity, including Adam and Eve, whom He created, and including the righteous Job, whom He had accepted. Even they did not see God’s real person. But why does God knowingly mask His real person? Some people say: “God’s afraid of scaring people.” Others say: “God hides His real person because man is too small and God is too big; humans are not allowed to see Him, or else they will die.” There are also those who say: “God is busy managing His work every day, He might not have the time to appear to let people see Him.” No matter what you believe, I have a conclusion here. What is that conclusion? It’s that God doesn’t even want people to see His real person. Being hidden from humanity is something God does deliberately. In other words, it is God’s intent for people to not see His real person. This should be clear to all by now. If God has never shown His person to anyone, then do you think God’s person exists? (He exists.) Of course He does. The existence of God’s person is indisputable. But as for how big God’s person is or what He looks like, are these questions mankind should investigate? No. The answer is negative. If God’s person is not a topic we should be exploring, then what is a question we should look into? (God’s disposition.) (God’s work.) Before we begin communicating the official topic, however, let’s return to what we were discussing just then: Why has God never shown His person to mankind? Why does God intentionally hide His person from mankind? There is only one reason, and that is: Although the created man has been through thousands of years of God’s work, there isn’t a single person who knows God’s work, God’s disposition, and God’s essence. Such people, in God’s eyes, are in opposition to Him, and God would not show Himself to people who are hostile toward Him. This is the sole reason God has never shown mankind His person and why He deliberately shields His person from them. Are you now clear on the importance of knowing God’s disposition?
