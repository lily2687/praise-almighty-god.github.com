## **[The Church of Almighty God](https://www.holyspiritspeaks.org/)** Testimony Video | "Living Out a Bit of Human Likeness Sure Is Great"
 
Living Out a Bit of Human Likeness Sure Is Great is the **[testimony](https://www.holyspiritspeaks.org/testimonies/)** of a Christian experiencing the judgment and chastisement of God's words. The main character takes on the duty of film director in her church and, after seeing her work achieve some results, she begins to feel that she's an indispensable talent. Her disposition becomes more and more arrogant: She always wants to have the final say in her duty and refuses to listen to brothers' and sisters' suggestions. She also talks condescendingly to others, constrains her brothers and sisters and disrupts the church's work. After being removed from her duty, through reading God's words and reflecting on herself, she gains some understanding of her satanic nature of arrogance and conceit, and she is no longer as impudent as before. When encountering issues, she intentionally seeks the truth and listens to others' opinions, finally living out a bit of a human likeness. She experiences for herself that God's judgment and chastisement are His true love and salvation for mankind.
