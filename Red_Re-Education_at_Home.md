Zheng Yi is a Christian. When he heard about the CCP government's brutal persecution of **[Eastern Lightning](https://www.holyspiritspeaks.org/gospel/eastern-lightning-come-from/)** and the arrest of Christians during his work in the United States, he pondered, "The CCP is an atheist party, a satanic regime that resists God most.

Zheng Yi's father, Zheng Weiguo, is the minister of the United Front Work Department in a city of China. When he learned that his children had believed in Almighty God, he strongly opposed it and repeatedly used the rumors and fallacies of the CCP government to stop them from believing in God. On many occasions, Zheng Yi and his sister debated with their father. This spiritual war of the family ultimately ended with the truth triumphing over fallacy and the fact over rumor!
