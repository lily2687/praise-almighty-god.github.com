In mainland China, there is such a group of Christians who fortunately accept the gospel of **[Almighty God](https://github.com/lily2687/praise-almighty-god.github.com/blob/master/Almighty_God_and_the_Lord_Jesus_Are_One_God.md)** in the last day. They know God’s eager desire to save man from Almighty God’s words. they accept God’s commission and bear their missions, spreading the gospel of the kingdom and thereby having suffered the resistance and insult from the religious world as well as the CCP government’s arrest and persecution. They even run the risk of their lives. Under such hard and severe circumstances, they feel weak and pained but, under the encouragement and guidance of God’s word, they never lose their testimony when facing Satan’s attacks and have spread God’s end-time gospel to every family. Just as the Bible says, “Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me”(Matthew 16:24) “And he said to them, Go you into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature”(Mark 16:15). New **[Gospel Dance Video](https://www.holyspiritspeaks.org/video-category/kingdom-songs-of-praise/)**, “The Rocky Road of the Gospel”, leads you to deeply understand how Christians defy hardship to spread God’s gospel under the guidance of God’s word.

**God's word of this video:**

“**As members of the human race and devout Christians, it is the responsibility and obligation of us all to offer up our minds and bodies for the fulfillment of God’s commission, for our entire being came from God, and it exists thanks to the sovereignty of God.** ”

“**Are you aware of the burden on your shoulders, your commission, and your responsibility? ……How many people are waiting for you to be their shepherd? Is your task a heavy one? They are poor, pitiable, blind, and at a loss, wailing in the darkness—where is the way? How they yearn for the light, like a shooting star, to suddenly descend and dispel the forces of darkness that have oppressed man for so many years. Who can know the full extent to which they anxiously hope, and how they pine, day and night, for this? ……Are you not willing to strive, out of your love for God, to save these survivors? Are you not willing to use all of your energy to repay God—He who loves mankind like His own flesh and blood?** ”
